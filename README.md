# GPAConverter-Group6

## Introduction
A device that performs conversion of grades to the standard number which is specified to that grade based on numeric data which are entered by pressing alphabetical data which are entered by pressing alphabetical and control keys which is also known as GPA calculating machine. A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and more sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, factorial, logarithms, trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions. This calculator can handle GPA conversion from grades and percentage conversion from GPA.

## Defining System
Provide operations for the user to select one at a time.
Can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence of steps each of which applies one of the operations including input of subjects, followed by their respective grades then calculation of GPA or percentage.
Can do some of the conversion of alphabetical grades into numerical GPA up to 10 and conversion of that GPA to percentage up to 100.

## High Level Requirements:
A GPA calculator that should perform inputs of grades , conversion of grades to specific standard scores or numbers assigned and calculating the GPA and percentage from the inputs.
The Calculator was developed using standard C++ language and should run on all machines supporting gcc compiler.
Should display following menu bar to users like -
Input the numbers of subjects and their grades
GPA conversion
Percentage conversion
On encountering a grade else then A, B, C, D, E, F the display should read "Please enter grades between A, B, C, D, E, F
Includes buttons with alphabet A, B, C, D, E, F
Calculator must provide with on, off and memory operations.

## Low Level Requirements:

The calculator has the following things like number from 0-9, number of subjects, percentage, GPA. In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well-known conversion standards. If the calculations is impossible the calculator has to display information helping the user to resolve the erroneous situation, like:

On encountering a grades else then A, B, C, D, E, F he display should read & quote "Please enter grades between A, B, C, D, E, F.

User can perform percentage to GPA conversion.

In this project we use git hub repository to store the project for visual studio code for debugging the code

Some other tools are used for making UML diagrams

Minimum system requirement is need for the application to run.
